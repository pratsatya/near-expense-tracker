<br /><br />

## Project Flow and Methods
---
Below is a list of methods to interact with the smart contract.
* Setup
```

yarn

#run tests
yarn test

#dev-deploy
yarn deploy
```

* Environment and Contract Init
```
#export account-id from dev-account.env
export CONTRACT_ADD=

echo $CONTRACT_ADD

#init contract
near call $CONTRACT_ADD new --accountId $CONTRACT_ADD
```

* Example Commands
```
#add a trip
near call $CONTRACT_ADD add_trip '{"trip_metadata":{"trip_name":"trip test1"}}' --accountId $CONTRACT_ADD --deposit 1

#add trip members
##trip should exist
near call $CONTRACT_ADD add_trip_members '{"trip_id":"1","new_members":["a.testnet","b.testnet"]}' --accountId $CONTRACT_ADD --deposit 1

#add an expense in a trip
#trip should exist
#lender and ower must be members in the trip
#lender cannot be same as ower
#amount in yocto
near call $CONTRACT_ADD add_trip_expense '{"trip_id":"1","expense_name":"expense 1","ower_id":"a.testnet","lender_id":"b.testnet","loan_amount":10000000000000000000000}' --accountId $CONTRACT_ADD --deposit 1

#update an expense
#trip should exist
#expense id should exist
#lender and ower must be members in the trip
#lender cannot be same as ower
